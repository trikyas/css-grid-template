Do you remember, the bills you have to pay? I'm a space invader. Strange, mad celebration. I never thought I'd need so many people. You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it. Wake up in the wrong town, boy you really get around. Somewhere, someone's calling me when the chips are down. You were a talented child. I'm afraid of Americans.

If you stay you won't be sorry. Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads. I care for no one else but you. I kissed a lot of people that day. Turn to the left! I'm afraid of Americans.</p>
